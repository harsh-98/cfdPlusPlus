## Sensors used

* **Rain Guage Sensor**: Used measuring the amount of precipitation (especially rainfall amounts) fallen during a given time interval at a certain location. In short â€“ the rain gauge are used to measure rainfall.
* **Soil Moisture Sensor**: measures the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighting of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content. 
* **Accelerometer**: An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration. Proper acceleration, being the acceleration of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame, is not the same as coordinate acceleration, being the acceleration in a fixed coordinate system.
